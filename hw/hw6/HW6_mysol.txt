Q1
a) Availability and partition-tolerance are held
b) Availability and consistency are held
c) Availability and consistency are held

Q2
a) No. The distribution of R = 1,W= N is great for read-heavy workloads.
The configure of R = 4, W = 8 is great for write-heavy workloads.

b) Two conflicting writes may occur at the same time if the W that is smaller or equal to N/2 

c) No, because W + R = N instead of larger than N.

d)Yes, because there is a overlap and the write operation that could not lead to a conflicting
write. The overlap ensures that any read operation that follows a write operation will
see the most recent completed write operation. 

Q3
With the change of phase 2 and new phase 3 in Three-Phase Commit, the nodes that have
voted to the prepare message will know whether the transaction will be committed or
aborted. When the coordinator or any other participants fail, the remaining participants 
continue on dealing with the preCommit request or doAbort request instead of waiting to
the failed nodes being recovered. By this buffer phase, the delay is decreased.
